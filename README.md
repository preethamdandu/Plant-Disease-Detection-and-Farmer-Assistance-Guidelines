# ðŸŒ± Plant Disease Detection and Farmer Assistance Platform

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application designed to help farmers diagnose plant diseases, get weather and market information, and connect with agricultural volunteers for support. It leverages machine learning for image-based disease detection and provides a collaborative Q&A platform for the farming community.

---

## Features

- **AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection:**  
  Farmers can upload images of plant leaves to receive instant disease diagnosis using a deep learning model.

- **Weather Forecasting:**  
  Real-time and forecasted weather data for various regions.

- **Market Price Information:**  
  Up-to-date fruit and vegetable prices by city/district.

- **Q&A Platform:**  
  Farmers can post questions; volunteers can answer and assist based on location.

- **Real-Time Notifications:**  
  Users receive notifications for new questions, answers, and messages.

- **Resource Sharing:**  
  Volunteers can upload and share agricultural resources.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Django (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript
- **Database:** SQLite (default, can be swapped for PostgreSQL)
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras (for disease detection)
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Web Scraping:** BeautifulSoup, Requests
- **Other:** Django Admin, RESTful APIs
